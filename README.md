# Caltech Assigment


These are my solutions to the asisgnment-1 of Data analysis class. The Professor
of the course is Prof [Andrew Staurt](http://stuart.caltech.edu)

The report i have submitted for evalution, was done by analysing by code from my
intial commit. Hence If you find any diffence between the observed value and 
output in report then its highly likely that its becuase of this reason.
